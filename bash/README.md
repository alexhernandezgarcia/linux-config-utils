# Personalisation of Linux terminal

The file [`.bashrc`](./.bashrc) contains some of my personalisation items for the Linux terminal, like enabling searching through the command history with the arrow keys and aliases I find useful (for example, I use all the time `lsa` for `lsa -lAh`). The file [`.bash.config.color.py`](./.bash.config.color) is used by [`.bashrc`](./.bashrc) to change the `bash PS1` variable for personalising the colours and aspect of the bash terminal. I apologise for not knowing the source where I got the original file.
